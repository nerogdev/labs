# ALU Simulator
Learning C fundamentals.
This program implements basic aritmetic and logical operations, taking into account a `struct` data named *Float_t*
This new data type stores as integers the parts of a binary representation of a float number.

# Arithmetic ops
- Add Float_t
- Substract Float_t
- Multiply Float_t
- Divide Float_t

# Logical ops
- AND Float_t
- OR Float_t
- NOT Float_t

# Optional requirements
To make easy the development we are using `npm -v 8.3.1` of nodejs. You can execute at the current directory the following command to compile and execute the program result:

```sh
npm start
```
You can find the program result in `dist/alu-simulator`
